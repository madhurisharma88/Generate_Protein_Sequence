## ðŸ§¬ Project Overview
This project focuses on generating realistic protein sequences using deep generative models, such as GANs. The model aims to learn the distribution of real protein sequences and produce synthetic sequences with structural and functional relevance.
- Trains a generative model using GAN on real protein sequences.
- Evaluates generated sequences using metrics like identity, RMSD, TM-score, and FID.
- Optionally integrates structural features from UniProt.
